# Concatenate-and-swap
In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of a and b respectively. In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b (a+b). In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a' and b' . a' and b' are the same as a and b, respectively, except that their first characters are swapped.
